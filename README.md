```sh
typst compile main.typ .output/main.pdf --font-path=assets/fonts
```

## Notes

Presently requires the use of Typst v0.13.1 which has recently become outdated.

An update to the upstream template used in generating the CV should resolve the issue.

Personally I'm wondering...

_What is the best way for me to manage package dependencies in cases like these?_

Previously, I had Typst installed via Arch pacman.
I am unsure if the pacman version can be pinned or downgraded.

Instead, I have for now uninstalled the Arch package version and instead installed
version 0.13.1 explicitly via the Rust cargo package management system.

Perhaps I should always do this when managing Rust software...
but then I do not know how this might conflict with use of Mise and the management
of several Rust versions.

Rust compiles to binaries so... should be fine, right?

## Deployment

_Weird to be talking about "deployment" of my CV but it does get generated by GitHub CI so..._ 🤷‍♂️

When CV changes are made, these should be committed and pushed as one would in any other
repository.

To generate a new version of the published CV, a tag must be created, e.g.

```
git tag v1.0
git push --tags
```

The newly published version can be linked to at
`https://github.com/thombruce/cv/releases/latest/download/Thom-Bruce_CV.pdf`,
which should always point to the latest release.
